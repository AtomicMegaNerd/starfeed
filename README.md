# Starfeed

![Starfeed](./img/starfeed.png)

Starfeed scans the current list of your Github stars, grabs the Releases RSS feed for each repo it finds, and publishes them to your own self-hosted [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/) RSS aggregator. Then by hooking up an RSS client to your FreshRSS server you can easily follow the releases for any of the repos that you have starred.

Starfeed will omit any RSS feeds from Github that are empty. It will also remove any feeds for repos that you are no longer starring.

Starfeed is written in Go and currently relies purely on the standard library with no external dependencies. The Docker image for this app is a little bigger than 25MB!

## Pre-Requisites

### Required Software

- You must have [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org) deployed in your local network. It must be reachable from the Starfeed Docker container.
- You must have an API token generated in FreshRSS that has permissions to create/edit/delete feeds.
- You must have an API token for GitHub with permission to read starred repos.
- You must have [Docker](https://docker.com) or [Podman](https://podman.io) set up to run the container.
- To build and run the app locally you need to install [Go](https://go.dev), [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev), and [Direnv](https://direnv.net/).

### Setting the Environment

The following environment variables need to be set for Starfeed to function correctly. For local
development, the best way is to create an `.envrc` file. This should remain in the `.gitignore` and
`.dockerignore` for obvious reasons.

```bash
use flake

export STARFEED_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=github_token
export STARFEED_FRESHRSS_URL=url_to_freshrss
export STARFEED_FRESHRSS_USER=freshrss_user
export STARFEED_FRESHRSS_API_TOKEN=freshrss_api_token
export STARFEED_DEBUG_MODE=true
export STARFEED_SINGLE_RUN_MODE=true
```

Then activate your environment with:

```bash
direnv allow
```

This will load all of the environment variables in `.envrc` into your environment while you are in the project directory. See the direnv docs for more information.

## Running with Docker or Podman

You can use either **Docker** or **Podman** to run Starfeed. The instructions below show both options.

### Using Docker

#### Pull and Run the Image

```bash
docker pull atomicmeganerd/starfeed:latest
docker run --env-file $PATH_TO_ENV_FILE -t atomicmeganerd/starfeed:latest
```

#### Using Docker Compose

If you want to build and run the app locally:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Using Podman

#### Pull and Run the Image

```bash
podman pull atomicmeganerd/starfeed:latest
podman run --env-file $PATH_TO_ENV_FILE -t atomicmeganerd/starfeed:latest
```

#### Using Podman Compose

If you want to build and run the app locally:

```bash
podman-compose up --build
```

---

### Build and Run Go Binary (Local Development)

This app uses [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) to build and run the app. You can use the following command to build the app:

#### Build

```bash
task build
```

#### Run

As long as the environment variables are set up (with `direnv`) you should be able to run the app:

```bash
task run
```

To run the tests:

```bash
task test
```
